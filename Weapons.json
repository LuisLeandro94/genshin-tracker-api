Till one day, it fell into the hands of a gentleman thief who was never caught. Its user shot the crowns from the heads of nobles in utter silence. It shot through many a tightened bond, and disarmed many a pursuing soldier. It once vowed to bring light to a darkened age. To bring justice, riches and gladness to the oppressed. In the past, he did indeed bring justice, riches and gladness to the oppressed, and he brought fear unto those in power, giving them countless sleepless nights in their impotent rage. He brought light footsteps like rain to the roofs and terraces, and he brought song to the bards in the squares. He even once pried a sapphire from a noble's regalia to give to a blue-eyed witch, who hunted the vile with spear in hand. But even to the last, he was unable to bring a single smile to the lips of the witch whom his soul loved, who was as cold as the sapphire he gave her. In the end, seeking death, her flower-like face was marked with a criminal's brand, and none knew where she went thereafter. Abandoning his vow, he sailed into the ocean that belonged to no one. \"Pray tell, does she still recall my song? Does she remember those years that pursue me even now, of the wine-scented streets and the songs sung of her?\"",

These blazing rituals were especially commonplace during that ancient period of strife. For the dreams and delusions of the silent corpses of gods would produce evil miasmas, Snatching away the citizens who were no longer theirs, and those who never were theirs also. Then, a merciful doctor heard a whisper from within the flame as fierce as the red sunset, From within the crackling and snapping of withered grass. \"Only an unbound flame can purify the filth of this world.\" \"Lift up this scarlet firewood. With it, you shall repel every demon.\" So the doctor took up that devilishly red staff, igniting all that was impure. Those who have passed, unable to bear deep sadness, but who have since become shrouded by ill karma and calamity, They shall be reduced to ashen butterflies in this flame, and receive relief from their misfortunes and hurts. As for the doctor who lit those countless flames, legend has it that they, too, were reduced to smoke in the shape of a lovely butterfly.

Awoken from blind love, she realized she was the only one who spoke with sincerity. For he spoke of love, but was only accompanied by razor winds. He looked down at the bent backs of his subjects in the howling wind, believing it to be a sign of their adoration and unwavering obedience. It was the era when the Tyrant of the North Wind warred with the Lord of the Tower. The huntress thought herself loved by the slavemaster. At the end of the war, and when the wind of resistance first blew, in the company of a nameless young man, elf, and knight, she scaled the towering spire and challenged the eccentric lord. \"Finally, I shall hold his gaze.\" But it was not until the moment when her arrow flew toward him, and when the piercing wind was about to rip her asunder, that she finally realized their distance apart.",

Tianheng and the surrounding area would run dry, and the miners would dig further. The result was a network of mine shafts stretching across the region in all directions. At their deepest point, the mines reached all the way to the earth's core.\nSlowly, the once-quiet region was beset by increasingly frequent disturbances. With a deep growl, the earth would tremble, causing landslides on the mountains and cave-ins in the mines.\nIn the night, the aggrieved souls of the innocent who died in the disasters could be heard wailing in the distance.\n\nThen one day, a stranger arrived at Mt. Qingce.\nThe stranger was dressed in a full-length gown and spoke in an esoteric and eloquent manner. He claimed to be a thaumaturge visiting Liyue on a quest to find two craftsmen by the names of Yun and Han.\nYun Huang, the first daughter of the Yun family, was then resident in Qingce Village. She immediately sent a messenger to fetch Han Ce, first son of master craftsman Han Wu.\nThe thaumaturge informed them both that in the past, the Yuns and Hans had jointly crafted a catalyst for the thaumaturges of the world.\nWith unrest now spreading through Liyue, the thaumaturges wished to provide the Yuns and Hans with a piece of crimson Cor Purum, in the hope that it might help the people of Liyue through this troubled time.\n\nOn receiving the message, Yun Huang and Han Ce lit the furnace at once and crafted a blackcliff catalyst with the crimson Pur Lapis as its core.\nThe crimson stone resonated with the ley lines of the earth. A blood-red glow would fade in and out as if to give forewarning of imminent tectonic activity.\nJust as the stars guide those who travel by night, so this catalyst was the light that gave safe passage to the people in Liyue through that tumultuous time of landslides and cave-ins. It was placed at the foot of Mt. Tianheng for all to see.\nWhen peaceful days finally returned, the Blackcliff Agate quietly disappeared without a trace, just as had faded the fury of the earth's core.",

But it is one that the bladesmith must overcome if he is to free himself from the shackles that bind him and reach new heights of competency in his trade.\nHan Wu struggled to see beyond the limits of his casting techniques. Thanks to a contact of his good friend in the house of Yun, he was able to go with a crew to the Chasm to personally procure the materials for his new weapon.\nBut a cave-in trapped the crew in the mine shaft for four days.\n\nImprisoned within the impenetrable rock walls of the cave, the crew found their mining tools to be of no use.\nDeprived of all the natural light and thus of all the knowledge as to the time of day, one by one the trapped crew succumbed to the madness and despair.\nJust when they thought all hope was lost, Han Wu thought he saw a faint flickering emanate from the corner of the cave, where lay the prototype sword he had brought with him into the mine.\nWith that sword he carved their way to freedom, and the survivors emerged from the pits of the earth into glorious bright sunlight.\nbut the moment that the first ray of sunlight made contact with the blade, it shattered into a million pieces.\nAll strength left the master craftsman's legs and he collapsed on the ground. Months later, he remade the sword and declared, \"This sword shall be named the Blackcliff Longsword, for it is made of blackcliff.\"\nAll who beheld the Blackcliff Longsword were bewitched by its beauty, spellbound by its sharpness, and transfixed by its tenacity. But the crew spoke not a word of what they had witnessed during their ordeal in the mine...\n\nDeep in the all-consuming darkness, when the master craftsman struck his blade against the cave wall with all his might, the sword released a deafening roar, like thunder sweeping across the plains. Perhaps the crew knew that the sword's cry was to foreshadow an earthquake years into the future...",

The son's name was \"Han Ce, the Cold and Calculating.\" Cold, because his father wished him to be cool-headed and rational. Calculating, because his father wished him to be precise in his craft, that he might inherit the family business.\nBut Han Ce had other ambitions. During his days as a student, Han Ce idled away his study time on martial arts fiction, while spending his free time practicing the art of the polearm up in the mountains. He was consumed by the desire to become a martial nomad, roaming the world with his pole for protection.\nWhen he scoured the lands in search of Aerosiderite, he sought not the rare ore itself but the thrill of adventure. And when he ascended the highest peaks to commune with the adepti, he desired not the wisdom of the sages but the tale of his travels.\nHan Ce cared not for the flames of the furnace and the working of weaponry. His father scolded him, but it was to no avail. Eventually, Han Ce left home one day without bidding his father farewell.\n\nIn his later years, Han Wu was involved in a mining accident that profoundly changed his temperament. Han Ce caught wind of the ordeal and hurried home to see his father, traveling through the night.\nPreviously hot-tempered and never short of something to say, Han Wu was now calm and quiet. He no longer held any animosity towards his son for his reluctance to take over the forge.\nFinally, the father and son grew close for the first time in their lives. Han Ce was ashamed of his past actions, but knew not how to redeem himself.\nSeveral years later, Han Wu breathed his last. Thus ended the life of a master craftsman of a generation. Per his father's will, Han Ce retrieved an archive of weapon designs from the study - they were the fabled prototypes.\nThe archive was sealed inside a wooden chest along with a letter addressed to Han Ce.\n\"To my dear son, Han Ce. The world is vast and filled with many marvels. May you always see the wonder in the world, wherever your journey takes you.\"\n\nThe designs were covered in comments penned by his father.\nHan Ce was overjoyed at the sight and proceeded to peruse them all night long.\nAs Han Ce stepped outside the door of the study at the first light of dawn, he watched in wonder as a meteorite fell from the sky. It crashed down right before him in front of the Han residence, landing perfectly vertical.\nA host of emotions flooded Han Ce's heart. Tears both of joy and sorrow streamed down his face as he cried, \"The heavens have spoken! The heavens have spoken!\"\nHan Ce took the pitch-black aerosiderite and added it to the blackcliff that remained in the forge. Following his late father's designs to the letter, he crafted a pointed pole with a sharp tip that shimmered like ice and a body hard as bedrock.\nHan Ce could have traveled the world with this trusty weapon in hand, but he chose not to. For Han Ce vowed that starting that day, never again would the flames of the furnace die out, and never again would the working of weaponry cease.",

He was certain that it was his trip into the mine that had disturbed the dragon from underground and the meteorite from the heavens.\nHe forced himself up from his sickbed, lit the fires of the furnace once more and forged a mighty broadsword.\nWhen it was ready, Han Ce took the sword into the mine shaft.\nThere, on instructions from his father, he erected a shrine as tall as himself and placed the sword inside to ward off evil and rebuke the dragon.\nHan Wu died peacefully in his sleep several years later.\nAt the moment of Han Wu's death, a traveler passing by the mine shaft at Mt.

The house of Yun has long since established itself in Liyue as a family of craftsmen. At the time of this bow's inception, the seventh head of the house, Hui, was well-renowned as a member of the Qixing. Yun Hui had but one child, a daughter, by the name of Huang. As per family custom, should she marry, her husband would take over as head of the house. Having been raised by an unyielding martial artist, Huang refused to take this path, and instead took over as the daughter she was, inciting endless gossip amongst the people. But Yun Huang took control at a hard time. The continent was troubled. Even the loftiest of peaks and deepest of caves collapsed to a symphony of low roars. The bouny of the earth beneath them became almost unreachable, threatening to bring an end to the legacy of their craft. One night Yun Huang lay awake unable to sleep, tortured by her worries that her family's name would end with her. Amidst the sorrow that enveloped her, she could do naught but call upon the heavens and pray for celestial intervention in her desperate situation. It was then that Han Ce, who had long since abandoned his family business and wandered the continent, arrived in the village in his craftsman's attire.

Should it please you, give this bow a try.\" Huang fired an arrow into the sky. It roared across the heavens like angry thunder, as the sound of the bowstring being released reverberated throughout the mountains.

But he was lost in his pursuit to perfect both structure and materials, And there was to be no stopping him as he fled this reality. Though one day the bow was taken up by a soldier, who promptly shot down a wilde goose. \"This is the bow I seek\" Said the heartless soldier, commending the weapon in his hands, As the final cry of the bird he had murdered pierced his heart, just as his arrow had pierced the bird's.",

In this lies the essence of Favonius Bladework: light, swift, and precise in the defense of Mondstadt. At age of twenty-seven, Rostam received the title of Wolf Pup. Knights of Favonius tradition dictated that the titles of Lion and Wolf were reserved for those of great leadership potential.

The team was founded by a mercenary leader from Liyue, who passed on his lifetime's worth of knowledge to the Outriders. The tracking skills they acquired, along with the ability to sense when danger was afoot, were unique among all the knights. Hence, the skills of the Outriders were invaluable to the Knights of Favonius. This lasted until the first of the Outriders, for reasons unknown to the Knights, ultimately left the order.

Nevertheless, there are still those who work tirelessly to maintain the dignity of the Outrider title.",

The disc represents the cosmos and thus takes a circular form. At the center is a piece of Cor Purum, representing a heavenly body suspended in the firmament. After the great chaos subsided, sinister forces still remained in the world. Thus, people abandoned traditional martial arts and tools and espoused the supernatural arts. But the techniques used in catalyst production were antiquated, having remained unchanged in over a century. Thus, the catalysts of that age were fragile and broke on first use. The thaumaturges flocked to Liyue and pleaded with Yun Hui, head of the house of Yun, to design a new type of catalyst for them. Yun Hui proceeded to add a catalyst to the then-new series of improved weapon designs known as \"the prototypes.\" The disc is made of wood and rare ore. The Cor Purum in the center was a gift from the thaumaturges. Cor Purum is produced by firing Cor Lapis in an urn for seven days squared (that is, forty-nine days) and then steeping it in fresh water drawn from a mountain spring for a further seven days squared. The dual purification of fire and water renders Cor Purum unbreakable, and the thaumaturges also believe it allows the stone to act as a vessel for primordial cosmic energy. A catalyst with Cor Purum at its core can channel cosmic energy with the turning of the disc. Twelve full turns works the energy into its purest form. Yun Hui observed that the Cor Purum had a warm, golden glow like that of amber. After discussion with the thaumaturges, he proposed to name the catalyst \"Prototype Amber.\" Thereafter, all catalysts made in Liyue were modeled on Yun Hui's prototype.",

Weighing in at close to forty pounds, this weapon's hilt is made from a rare ore, while the blade is forged from the finest steel. All you will see when it is swung are blinding flashes of light, powerful enough to devour the clouds and blot out the moon. After the great disaster, the Yun family forge joined forces with the master craftsman Han Wu to find a way to push past the constraints of contemporary blade design and revolutionize their craft. Thus was born a new series of weapon models, simply named \"the prototypes.\" The first greatsword built using the new design was unusually understated in its final appearance. The underwhelming sight of dull, blotchy gold masked the weapon's true strength. While not much to look at, any who cared to try it would discover that it was weighty but not unwieldy. Han Wu, the master craftsman who forged the weapon, traveled north through the night to hand the sword over to a martial artist who followed the chivalric code. The martial artist inspected the blade closely before trialing it. The blade howled like the wind and in an instant decimated the entire bamboo forest. It was a rare sight to behold. The martial artist said to Han Wu, \"This blade is endowed with the elegance of antiquity. It is of equal value both as a weapon and an ornament.\" \"Such a fine creation possessed of both scale and subtlety is worthy of a name like no other. May it be known as Archaic.\" Due to its unparalleled strength, this sword subsequently became the model for thousands of greatswords in Liyue.",

The house of Yun in Liyue promoted a set of legendary prototype weapons to break free of their constraints and bring a new age to the power of their forces. An exceptional longbow that is mainstream among the armed forces. The master craftsman Han Wu personally assembled this longbow at the request of his good friend Yun Hui. He employed every trade caravan he could find to bring to him a plethora of resources. In the end, he chose to use cudrania wood, fine steel and Irminsul branches brought back from the abyss. The result is a beautifully superior bow, sturdy and easy to grip, and cool to the touch. The bow's arc is as beautiful as the crescent moon, albeit a darker shade, like a light moon hanging low amidst a foggy night sky. When an arrow from the bow pierces the sky, the string's light is thin and cold, reminiscent of an unforgettable moonflow. This resemblance has earned the bow the title of \"Crescent.\" Should its beauty captivate the people, then Liyue will be sure to see no shortage of similarly inspired bows.",

While trying out the sword at Mt. Tianheng, Han Wu accidentally dropped it on the ground. The sword responded by unleashing a swirling tornado of energy that cut a twelve-inch-deep hole into the solid mountain rock. Han Wu took it as a sign from the heavens. He declared, \"This sword shall be named Rancour, destroyer of rocks.\" This sword shakes mountains at their foundations and possesses the power of a thousand peaks in its tip.

The pole is made of black steel inlaid with gold. A lightning motif runs along the body, featuring streaks of lightning interspersed with stars.

By the time the monster threat was quelled, the remaining troops were few and far between, and each joined the civilian community where they were based. Though peace now prevailed, it sparked a martial arts renaissance that spread throughout the land. Demand for all kinds of weaponry spiked, especially for superior quality items, and manufacturers could not keep pace. To find a solution, Yun Hui of the house of Yun met with master craftsman Han Wu and the two conducted intensive research behind closed doors. By the time they emerged, both men's beards had grown by twelve inches. Their new weapon designs, \"the prototypes,\" were finally ready to revolutionize weaponry manufacturing in Liyue. It was time to do away with the shackles of the past that plagued their craft. The first pole built to the new specifications had a black-and-gold appearance. The spike at the tip was two inches longer than the previous standard. It was truly a deadly weapon, but one with a composed and commanding presence. It was left to bask overnight in the moonlight. At the first light of dawn, the tip shone with the cold, piercing light of a star against the dim sky. At this ethereal sight, Yun Hui's mind was flooded with memories of his father's glory, for his father's name made reference to the stars. Greatly moved, he decided to dedicate the weapon to his father's memory. For this reason the weapon became known as \"Starglitter\" among later practitioners of the halberd arts in Liyue.",

In the eyes of the Imunlaukr clan, combat existed not for protection, for glory, or for gaining territory. Rather, it was for the amusement of the gods, high up in the heavens, for whom little else could serve to entertain. Monsters and outlaws, they fought them all the same, with no regard for whether, this time, they would return to their beloveds afterwards. For none of that mattered. What mattered was to roar, loud and clear, in the heat of bloody battle. That was duty fulfilled. Such hot blood running through the veins should not have been conducive to a long history for the Imunlaukr clan. For their fight was one without end, and without hope of victory. And yet, as the snow slowly melted and Mondstadt began to take shape, gradually they realized: They had found something to fight for at last.",

In the past, seamen would use the bones of such monsters as figureheads, And with them frighten the beasts who dwelt in the deep sea, and who envied the landâ€”dwellers. In the stormy oceans of the ancient past, those who put out to sea would often never be seen again. The carefree sea shanties of today were, in years long gone, farewell songs that left people in mournful silence. There was a greatsword-wielding captain in those days who enjoyed drinking and making merry before a voyage. When people questioned him, he laughed and said: \"I know myself. What is wine and song to me? Worry not. Once the sea and winds are right...\" But he would never finish that statement. He would only raise his mug, and call for all around to have another drink. Then, the day when the sea and winds came together arrived at last, and the stern of the great vessel rode them as it sailed. Deep into the misty sea it went, far across the darkening waves, into the ocean that teemed with sea creatures. And at last, neither the singing skipper nor his ship would ever return to the harbor ringed by mountains. After many days, the corpse of a sea monster from the deep was beached upon the shore by the waves. Brilliant white bone shone out from a great gash torn into it by a greatsword. Its blood had long been washed clean. \"When the sea and winds are right, I will go forth to sea and avenge her. O maiden charmed by the tidal song.\" \"So what if I sleep with the fishes? That way, I will be able to send my sea shanties into the deep where she dwells.\"",

This greatsword is expertly made with the finest materials. It is unique in that the edge closest to the wielder has been left dull. The dull edge is said to have been used as the hilt, enabling the wielder to switch forms by constantly shifting hand positions in combat. Though it is rarely acknowledged, this greatsword was in fact a foreign bladesmith's labor of love. The bladesmith knew himself to be dull of wits, and was anxious that this blade should not follow suit. Hence, he worked painstakingly on sharpening and balancing his beloved blade. Sparks flew as the bladesmith worked through many sleepless nights. The sword was recast and re-tempered countless times. All the while his mind was consumed with the hope of his lover's return, as well as his untold anxiety for her wellbeing. \"After the war is over...\" The bladesmith would ponder briefly, each time he paused for breath. \"Will this blade still be of use to her?\" \"Will she even make it home safely?\" These thoughts would linger in his mind for but a moment before he cast them aside and refocused his full attention on the blade. Indulging irresolvable anxieties was a futile endeavor - better to focus his faculties on creating the perfect welcome-home gift. Finally, the day came when the triumphant expeditionary force entered the city gates, their monstrous foes defeated at last. But the bladesmith had not had time to carve his lover's name onto the blade's body. With no time to lose, he grabbed the sword and rushed to meet his lover on the occasion of her return. Unfortunately, what would transpire next was to be an unbearable anticlimax. As the warrior removed her helmet, long, soft hair flowed down. She was growing her hair out, and hence would never need to wield a blade again for the rest of her days. Meanwhile, she had brought her lover a gift, too: A shiny new hunting bow. \"Romance is dead! I wasted all these years making you this greatsword, and now you don't even need it!\" The bladesmith was thoroughly miserable and would not stop complaining about the unfairness of it all. But his efforts had by no means been in vainâ€”at least he had finally succeeded in making a blade of the very finest quality.",

    "description": "A longsword used by the Wolf Knight. Originally just a heavy sheet of iron given to the knight by a blacksmith from the city, it became endowed with legendary power owing to his friendship with the wolves.",
    "lore": "The Knight of Boreas' journey ended at the city of Barbatos.\nWandering souls attract each other, boundless freedom begets only anxiety.\n\nUpon entering the city, the Knight of Boreas' companion bade him farewell in silence.\nFor the free-spirited Wolf resented the stone walls and lamplight, and yearned for the open wilds.\n\nThe Knight of Boreas' heart remained free, though his flesh was inside the prison-like city.\nMeanwhile, the windborne Wolf roamed the forest in the flesh, while his heart remained loyal to the Knight.\n\nThe Knight of Boreas rode again to hunt. The Wolf followed his scent into battle.\nStill one were they, the Wolf and the Knight.\n\nThough one they were, death comes for beasts sooner than men. Laying down his sword as a gravestone, the Knight of Boreas buried the Wolf in the remote countryside.\nThe Knight of Boreas then left the city behind, living instead the wandering life of a lone wolf.\n\nYet the eternal wolf spirit remained here,\nWatching over the land the Knight once protected.",
