The young challenger paid her final homage to the gladiator. When the vanity of victory and desire for freedom dissipated into the air like the morning fog, and when the light of dawn finally shone on the arena through layers of blood-soaked clouds, the gladiator saw a flying bird. One battle away from being free, the gladiator was defeated by an anonymous girl. Cries and howls burst out in the crowd like pounding thunder, but the victor refused to humiliate her opponent by execution. She refused to plunge her sword into the opponent's throat and end his life like that of a slave. The gladiator's healing wounds were covered with invisible feathers. He eventually set off on a journey, finally as free as a bird. His destination was the place where flowers bloom and birds soar.","location":"AR rewards, Quests, World Boss, or Weekly Boss","image":"https://media.impact.moe/img/artifact-icons/gladiators-destiny.webp","artifactSet":{"id":"gladiators-finale","name":"Gladiator's Finale","maxRarity":5,"twoPieceBonus":"ATK +18%","fourPieceBonus":"If the wielder of this artifact set uses a Sword, Claymore or Polearm, increases their Normal Attack DMG by 35%."}},{"id":8,"name":"Gladiator's Longing","type":"Sands of Eon","rarity":5,"description":"A timepiece that recorded the gladiator's days in the bloodstained Collosseum.

In her eyes, he saw both the timidity of a young girl and the ferocity of a young lioness. From his step, the girl saw the unbreakable shackles of age that the gladiator wore. It was a fight like the old gladiator has not had in years. Fierce, yet satisfying. But the fight ended in a flash. The sword plunged into the gladiator's heart and the sand in his hourglass crawled to a stop.","location":"AR rewards, Quests, World Boss, or Weekly Boss","image":"https://media.impact.moe/img/artifact-icons/gladiators-longing.webp","artifactSet":{"id":"gladiators-finale","name":"Gladiator's Finale","maxRarity":5,"twoPieceBonus":"ATK +18%","fourPieceBonus":"If the wielder of this artifact set uses a Sword, Claymore or Polearm, increases their Normal Attack DMG by 35%."}},{"id":9,"name":"Gladiator's Intoxication","type":"Goblet of Eonothem","rarity":5,"description":"The golden cup a champion gladiator drank from in ancient times.

Only in moments of victory could the slave have a taste of what it felt like to be a master. But the cost of this vain aspiration was for the faint glow of freedom to be shrouded by darkness. On the day of his triumph, the gladiator finally caught a glimpse of the world outside his cell. He was a step closer to freedom.
